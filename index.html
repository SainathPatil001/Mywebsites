        <h4>What is corona virus</h4>
        <p class="para1">
            Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
            in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
            to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
            severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
            and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
            discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

        </p>


        <h4> What is COVID-19</h4>


        <p>
            COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
            discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
            before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

        </p>

        <h4> What are the symptoms of COVID-19

        </h4>



        <p>




            The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
            dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
            congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
            usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
            don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
            (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
            treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
            becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
            and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
            heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
            People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
            attention.


        </p>

        <h4>How does COVID-19 spread</h4>

        <p>
            People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
            disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
            the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
            coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
            around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
            these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
            People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
            person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
            why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
            person who is sick.
        </p>

        <h4>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</h4>
        <p>
            Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
            transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
            through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
            spread?” </p>


        <h4>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</h4>
        <p>
            The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
            expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
            from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
            people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
            particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
            possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
            a mild cough and does not feel ill.</p>

        <h4>Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?</h4>
        <p>
            The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
            appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
            be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a
            main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
            COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
            this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
            after using the bathroom and before eating. </p>
        <h4>What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of
            disease</h4>
        <p>
            Protection measures for everyone
            Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
            available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many
            countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several
            have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
            have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
            situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
        </p>
        <h4> You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple precautions:<h4>
                <p>
                    • Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and
                    water.
                    Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
                    alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.<br>
                    • Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                    anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                    Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
                    droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
                    are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
                    COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.<br>
                    • Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
                    Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
                    Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
                    nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
                    can make you sick.<br>
                    • Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
                    respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                    with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then
                    dispose of the used tissue immediately.<br>
                    Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory
                    hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as
                    cold, flu and COVID-19.<br>
                    • Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
                    difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
                    Follow the directions of your local health authority.
                    Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                    information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
                    allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
                    health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread
                    of viruses and other infections.<br>
                    • Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local
                    areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
                    traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or
                    have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
                    Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of
                    these areas.
                </p>
